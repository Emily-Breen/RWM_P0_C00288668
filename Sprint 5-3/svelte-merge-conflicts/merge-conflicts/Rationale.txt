- Merging the Submit variant option from branch C and using the disabled option from branch D as they do different things so they dont conflict in purpose. Putting them together makes 
the button more useful - you can change how it looks and how it behaves

- Merging the different button types from primary and secondary using the data variant tag and keeping the style to make the button look faded and unclickable when its disabled. 
These styles affect different things, so they dont clash. keeping both makes it look better
